\title{A Completely Useless Mediation Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 100 rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{id}{Unique subject ID}
\item{X}{Treatment variable (binary, 0 or 1)}
\item{M}{Mediator variable (continuous), mostly explained by an unmeasured confounder}
\item{Y}{Outcome variable (continuous)}
}
}
\source{
Generated for illustrative/trolling purposes by the \code{easymediation} package.
}
\usage{
data(fake_mediation_data)
}
\description{
This dataset is an example of what \emph{not} to use for causal mediation analysis.
It features a treatment variable influenced by an unmeasured confounder, a mediator that's
more confounded than mediated, and an outcome that ignores your modeling assumptions entirely.
